## Customer Churn Prediction - CI/CD Exercise

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn based on structured data. The project demonstrates best practices in Python development, including modular design, testing, and model persistence. It is intended as part of a CI/CD exercise for robust ML model development.

## Features

Data ingestion: Loads customer data from CSV files.

Class balancing: Balances the dataset to handle imbalanced target classes.

Feature transformation: Applies transformations to prepare data for modeling.

Model training: Trains a machine learning classifier (using scikit-learn).

Model persistence: Saves the trained model for deployment or reuse.

Unit tests: Includes tests for core components using pytest.

Code quality: Enforces consistent style using black, isort, and autopep8.
